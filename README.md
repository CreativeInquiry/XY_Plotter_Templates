rough draft of instructions on how to use.

Flip switch (what is this switch) to right to manually home

Stop any currently running files

flip back

Connect

press home icon (necessary?)


about the machine: whereas for machines like the MH871, you can change the amount of time it takes to go in between two points in the file(and therefore you have more of a responsability to take care of it), with this software, you don't have to worry about moving too fast between points, bc it resamples for you (double check that this is actually true.

however, for both the MH871 and the xy-plotter you are responsible for making the plotters remain in the contained, safe space where it can draw without running into itself.
